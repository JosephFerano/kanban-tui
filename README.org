* About

This ia a Rust powered TUI Kanban Board built using the [[https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs][tui-rs]] library. It has
vim-friendly keybindings and while not the most featureful experience, it's fast
and gets the job done. You can save your TODOs in your project's root as either
a json file or a SQLite database.

* Installing

Clone this repository, then simply run ~cargo build~ or ~cargo run~
